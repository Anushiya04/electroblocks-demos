# Firmware Upload Instructions for ElectroBlocks

To use the ElectroBlocks Python library, you must upload its firmware to your Arduino Uno board.

## üîß Requirements

- Arduino Uno board
- Arduino IDE installed (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- USB cable

## üì• Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Arduino IDE**

2. **Download ElectroBlocks firmware**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ElectroBlocks/python
   - Download the firmware file located in `arduino/` directory.

3. **Open firmware file  in Arduino IDE**

4. **Connect your Arduino Uno**
   - Go to `Tools > Board` and select **Arduino Uno**
   - Go to `Tools > Port` and choose the correct COM port

5. **Upload the Sketch**
   - Click the ‚úÖ Verify button to compile
   - Click the ‚û°Ô∏è Upload button to upload the firmware

6. **Once uploaded, close the Arduino IDE**
   - This frees up the port for use with Python

## ‚úÖ Your Arduino is now ready to be controlled using Python!
